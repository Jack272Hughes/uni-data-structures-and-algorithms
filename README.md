# Uni data structures and algorithms
As part of my uni degree I was tasked with developing a program that solves a data driven problem that utilises multiple data structures and algorithms.

## How to run
This has been built using Java 11. To be able to run the jar you can use the following command:

NOTE: The paths to the products folder and costs.txt file are relative to where the command is run from,
unless you provide an absolute path.
```
java -jar /path/to/application.jar products costs.txt
```

There has been some example data provided inside the [data folder](data). If you `cd` into this directory you can then run the following command:
```
java -jar ../application.jar products costs.txt
```
